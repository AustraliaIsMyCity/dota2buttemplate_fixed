Please use dota_fixed.vmap to build. The vmap is larger than 25 mb so I'll have to link a google drive here.

You might notice that at your first build, the minimap is just grey or blank. There's an easy way to fix that. Before building the map, tick the "Create new minimap on load" and build. Once you've built the map and the minimap is blank, click "Run (Skip Build)" and it will fix itself.
